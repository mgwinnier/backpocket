                    <h2>Our Product</h2>
                    <p>We identified a gap in the roofing industry, where existing applications failed to cater to the individual needs of roofing companies and were often prohibitively expensive. To bridge this gap, we introduced the BackPocket Roofing App. Tailored to your company's needs and priced affordably, our application is a game changer in the industry. We stand so firmly behind our product that we require no payment until our clients approve the application.</p>
